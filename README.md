ConvexCluster
=============

R and Fortran code for AMA and ADMM splitting methods for convex clustering.

Remarks
=======

The Fortran code currently employs Intel's MKL for some matrix linear algebra. This is not essential for correctness.
Alternatives will be provided in the future.

This is accompanying code for a manuscript entitled 'Splitting Methods for Convex Clustering' (http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0499).
